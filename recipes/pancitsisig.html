        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Pancit Sisig is a delightful dish hailing from the Philippines. It's like a culinary playground where soft noodles, typically rice noodles, mingle with savory sisig goodness. Sisig, usually made from chopped and seasoned pig parts, brings a symphony of flavors to the dish, creating a melody that's both crunchy and succulent. Don't get me started on the noodles, you have to try it yourself.</p>
            <p>I hope you enjoy the dish as much as I did, and don't forget to sprinkle lemon all over it!</p>

                <li>Prepare a wok, plate on high heat then add a small amount of oil. Once it starts smoking add the seasoned chopped pork, garlic, onions, and ginger. Toss to mix and let the bottom sizzle and crisp</li>
                <li>Turn off heat, drizzle remaining calamansi juice, season with freshly ground black pepper and top with raw egg, give it one last mix to distribute egg evenly, then set aside</li>

            <ol>
